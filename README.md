Collecting, analysing, and tidying data generated from Samsung Galaxy S smartphone's acelerometer.

## Contents
* [`CodeBook.md`](CodeBook.md): Describes data and steps taken to analyse it.
* [`downloader.R`](downloader.R): `R` script download the data set required for this exercise.
* [`run_analysis.R`](run_analysis.R): `R` script to merge, clean, transform, and summarise the dataset.
* [`tidy_average.txt`](tidy_average.txt): The resulting tidy dataset of `run_analysis.R`.
* `README.md`: This file.

## What to expect
* Read [CodeBook.md](CodeBook.md) to see the steps performed when analysing data.
* Run [run_analysis.R](run_analysis.R), it will download and extract the data set if the [experimental data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) is not already available.
